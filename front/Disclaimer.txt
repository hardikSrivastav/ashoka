I'm not storing your data. It takes too much time to set up a database.

I have taken the data for this from:

1. Ashoka faculty directory and
2. Ashoka student dashboard and 
3. the student government portal for course ratings. 

These sources have been scraped. No data is sourced ethically. 

Just let me know if you want the data removed. I'll probably not remove it, but points for trying.

It's costing me $1 per request, please be worth â‚¹90 atle    ast.
