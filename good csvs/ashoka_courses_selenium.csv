It explores how different conceptualizations of civilization have shaped India, and how India has shaped the concept of civilization. We will focus mainly but not exclusively on British/Western colonialists and thinkers on one hand and South Asian intellectuals on the other to embark on a journey that will begin from the middle of the eighteenth century and go right up to the present.","Gaurav Churiwala Garg [gaurav.garg@ashoka.edu.in] ,Pooja Hazra [pooja.hazra_tf@ashoka.edu.in];","gaurav.garg@ashoka.edu.in, pooja.hazra_tf@ashoka.edu.in","The course will give students a fresh perspective on and a critical re-introduction to Indian history, how historical knowledge (including the kind of history that is taught in schools) is produced, and the many consequences of such knowledge in the making of our past, present, and future.",FC-0201-1,NA,
,FC,FC-0201-1,Indian Civilisations,"What is the ‘Indian civilization’ which we inhabit, and when was it formed? Did it get created in classical antiquity? Or was it a product of the colonial encounter? Discussions about Indian civilization are usually attentive to antiquity, or to what has been labelled as a ‘composite culture’ fostered by the advent of Islam in medieval times. This course will suggest that the term ‘composite culture’ is perhaps more appropriate to describe the modern Indian living conditions, habits and identities which burgeoned during British rule, and have flourished thereafter. It addresses the making of modern Indian civilization, not so much by looking at a distant past, but by examining developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We shall discuss politics and economics, but also – among other topics – food and dress, technology and health, the adoption of new technologies, and new items of mass consumption. To a greater extent than many people wish to admit, we are constituted by colonialism. Even the drinking of tea and coffee, so much a part of our culture now, dates to our relatively recent past, and provides a fascinating history to explore.","Indivar Kamtekar [indivar.kamtekar@ashoka.edu.in] ,Madhav Nayar [madhav.nayar_tf@ashoka.edu.in] ,Toorni Biswas [toorni.biswas_tf@ashoka.edu.in];","indivar.kamtekar@ashoka.edu.in, madhav.nayar_tf@ashoka.edu.in, toorni.biswas_tf@ashoka.edu.in",Appreciation of the diversity of narratives; location of ourselves in various narratives; awareness of historians' sources; insight into how histories are constructed from selected facts; historical thinking more generally.,FC-0201-2,Readings will be supplied electronically.,

FC-0503-3 | Monsoon 2025 | Instructor: Arindam Chakrabarti
COURSE DESCRIPTION
Human animals live through thinking (including perceiving, remembering, imagining), feeling and doing. Traditionally, in Western thought, thinking was called “minding,” doing was called “behaving”, while the emotions that they feel and express to each other were supposed to form a bridge between mind and behaviour.
In this course, we shall study—by careful reading, reasoned discussion, and structured writing—some basic human emotions (e.g. anger, fear, disgust, love, envy, wonder, boredom and fun) and their social and bodily expressions. Starting from modern classics such as William James’ psychology of emotions and Charles Darwin’s research on expressions of emotion in animals and humans, the course will end with contemporary analytic philosophy of actions. We shall use contemporary texts such as The Subtlety of Emotions by Aaron Ben-Ze'Ev, and The Blackwells Companion to Philosophy of Action,  and some articles from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and extracts from  A Neurophenomenology of Awe and Wonder: Towards a Non-Reductionist Cognitive Science.
The philosophical, social, aesthetic and political problems regarding our knowledge of other people’s feelings, empathy, enjoying and interpreting dance and theatre will also come up for discussion, depending upon the interest ‘expressed’ by the class.

This foundation course seeks to address overarching questions about the human brain, mind, and behavior which form the core of human experience. The brain is the biological foundation for mental processes, the mind creates the internal experience of these processes, and together they are manifested in behaviour in the form observable actions and responses. Using theoretical frameworks, cool psychological experiments, and state of the art brain imaging methods, this course will unravel how human beings acquire language, learn to read, develop number sense, experience emotion, feel music, pay attention and exhibit kindness, from a psychological and neurobiological perspective. The course will raise significant questions about cognitive processes, brain organisation and processing, psychological constructs and human diversity. Students will be encouraged to find answers using approaches that blend both the sciences and the arts.  
  The course will be structured into three parts as described below
In the first part students will be introduced to terminology and vocabulary in psychology and neuroscience. They will also be introduced to the organisation of the brain and different cognitive processes.
The second part of the course will discuss different cognitive abilities like reading, number processing, emotion processing, attention etc.. from a psychological and neurobiological perspective.

This course explores how we should understand the human mind, human nature, our responsibility for one another within social and political contexts. We will discuss whether a pleasurable life or a radically moral life can be considered good, and whether a meaningful life is necessarily a happy one. In the first unit, we will examine the question of how we should live and what it means to lead a good life. We will also consider our relationship to death and how the meaning of life might change if we were immortal. In the second unit, we will focus on our responsibility for one another and explore whether a truly altruistic or moral life constitutes a good life. In the third unit, we will turn to recent discussions on social injustice and artificial intelligence.

,FC,FC-0201-1,Quantitative Reasoning and Mathematical Thinking,"This course is meant for students who are either intimidated by mathematics or those who like mathematics but want to find ways of applying mathematics to the real world. It will be split into two sections. The first will build data literacy, the process of starting with raw numbers and using simple but powerful methods of interpreting the stories that the numbers tell. It will enable students to follow a systematic approach in building a toolkit to analyse numbers. The approach would be to draw constantly on real world examples to illustrate how simple quantitative tools are used to analyse and address complex problems.
How for instance, is standard deviation used to understand financial market behaviour? How can it be used to have a deeper insight into cost-of-living challenges for communities? Does ice-cream consumption actually drive up the crime rate in American cities as the data seems to suggest?

Module 1: Introduction to Contemporary Environmental Challenges
The students will be introduced to contemporary environmental issues such as climate change, biological extinction, pollution, food security, waste, water scarcity and forest degradation. The concepts of social equity and ecological and economic sustainability   will be introduced as ways of understanding environmental challenges globally and in developing societies such as India. 
Module 2,3: Population Growth and Sustainability
This module focuses on the relationship between population and the environment. Issues of population growth, stability, consumption patterns, demographic transition, coupled with human development challenges, social security, disease and scarcity will be addressed.
Module 4: Environment as a Commons
This module explores the understanding of  'environment' as a common. If indeed it is difficult to set up exclusive access to the environment then what kind of challenges may one anticipate in sharing the environment as a common? The module expects the students to familiarize themselves with Hardin's argument wherein commons are understood to fail, thus qualifying as a tragedy. A  counter to this argument is presented through Elinor Ostrom's work which argues for the possibility of successfully governing commons.
Module 5: Resource Scarcity at the Margins
This module explores the relationship between poverty, and environmental degradation, asking the larger questions of who suffers the most from environmental problems and disasters, and who pays the price. Do the interests of biodiversity and human well-being necessarily coincide? This module delves into the forms of resource and environmental governance that exist. We revisit the critical role of commons and the varying implications of environmental governance for social-ecological sustainability of ecosystem-dependent livelihoods at the margins.
Module 6,7: Climate Change I : Science and Impacts
In this module, the students will be introduced to the scientific debates on climate change and the symptoms and manifestations of global warming, which will be interpreted in context of climate history. The students will explore the impacts of climate change on agriculture, health, livelihoods and biodiversity, based on analysis of three short movies on climate-induced displacement.
Module 8,9: Climate Change II: Mitigation and Adaptation
In this module, we discuss climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly in the context of current international agreements and initiatives. We focus on the apparent inequities between the developed and developing world, and how these may affect the mitigative pathways being adopted, such as recent ‘net-zero’ commitments. There will be a focus on climate justice and carbon markets particularly in the context of the latest international negotiations on climate change at COP-26 held at Glasgow, 2020.
Module 10,11: Biodiversity Loss
The students will be introduced to the causes and consequences of species extinction and ecosystem degradation from the scientific and socio-political perspectives.  Varied paradigms of biological conservation in terms of  their socio-economic, political and biological implications and impacts.
Module 12: Water Scarcity and Conservation
Water, the source of all life, has become one of the most contentious issues on the planet. Growing scarcity and pollution of water, as well as the increasing unpredictability of floods and droughts, has necessitated a deeper look at the traditional strategies for water conservation, and how they can be revived.
Module 13: Water Bodies and their Governance
Using Indian rivers and lakes as examples, we explore the complex interplay amongst religious traditions, local needs, governmental authority, policy-making and ecological factors in perpetuating water pollution and mismanagement, one of the major environmental issues we are living with. Break-out sessions, created around different stake-holder groups, will debate the problem of river pollution.
Module 14,15: Agrarian Crisis and Livelihoods
The agrarian crisis in India has serious implications for rural livelihoods and food security. In this module, we explore the ecological and political perspectives on the abandonment of agriculture and declining productivity in India.
Module 16,17: Human-Wildlife Conflicts
With growing degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats, and expansion of human settlements, conflict situations with wildlife are occurring more frequently, resulting in grievous human injury and losses. In this module, we explore the causes and consequences of such conflict from different perspectives- behavioural, economic and social. Students will be encouraged to apply the concept of environmental commons to conflict management.
Module 18: Development as Disaster ?
A large number of environmental problems are created by large-scale industrial development and infrastructure that are undertaken without sufficient precautions. Thus it is necessary to explore the repercussions of the adopted development models for ecology and local livelihoods. We then explore the development processes and amelioratory laws and policies for environmental damage caused by infrastructural development in India.
Module 19,20: Governmental Responses: Environment Laws, Policies and Regulation
This module explores the historical context of environmental law-making and implementation in India. The role of government in environmental conservation will be analysed by the students, through discussion on key environmental laws in India such as the Forest Conservation Act, Forest Rights Act, the Wildlife Protection Act and the Environmental Protection Act. Regulatory laws such as Environmental Impact Assessment and Coastal Zone Regulation will also be covered. The aim will be to explore not only the contours and details of these laws but also their implementation, as well as their impacts on society and biodiversity.
Module 21: Role of Local Government
Local Governance is of utmost importance for environmental sustainability and conservation and rural well-being. Students will be introduced to local governmental mechanisms and institutions in India. The case study of Western Himalaya will be discussed based on the role of forest councils in environmental conservation.
Module 22,23 People’s response: Environmental Movements
Environmental movements in India are significant for their grassroots base and role in highlighting (and resolving) growing resource conflicts, particularly in view of the visible contestation among rural communities, corporate sector and governments. Students will compare and contrast various environmental movements in India from the points of view of sustainability. Three landmark environmental movements will be discussed in class: Chipko Andolan, Ralegaon Siddhi and Narmada Bachao Andolan.
Module 24: Ecosystem Services and their Valuation
Monetization of ecosystem services has emerged as one of the possible solutions for safe-guarding nature. We will discuss the concept of ecosystem services, their valuation and the potential of such understanding for conservation. The advantages and pitfalls of using this approach will be debated. The concept of green GDP will be introduced as a way to stem the degradation of ecosystem services globally.
Module 25, 26: Traditional Knowledge and the Environment
Traditional knowledge has historically been the crucible for understanding and conservation of nature, which empowers indigenous communities and economies. It is important to explore the concept, as well as its applicability and usefulness for human well-being in modern times. Convention on Biological Diversity and Biological Diversity Act will be discussed in the context of safe-guarding indigenous people’s intellectual Property Rights.

,FC,FC-0201-1,Environmental Studies,"Today, world leaders increasingly emphasize the importance of protecting the environment. This idea of how nature and the environment need to be protected has evolved over time—from a focus on preserving untouched wilderness to a more structured discipline centered on biodiversity and wildlife conservation. In this course, we will explore what nature and biodiversity mean to us. We will explore how nature can have many values and meanings - Is it a resource to be managed and safeguarded for human benefit, or does it deserve protection in its own right? We use nature conservation to discuss how new ideas emerge.
    We will also discuss what biological diversity is and how we can measure it. Where is biodiversity located and how do we prioritise areas for conservation?  We will discuss how ideas towards understanding the natural world emerge, for example Rene Descartes' bête-machine, E.O. Wilson’s biophilia, Raworth’s Doughnut Economics. Can our ideas about nature shape how we wish to conserve it - should we sell nature to protect it? 
  Throughout the course, we will underscore that nature conservation problems are multi-faceted. George Schaller describes the social and political nature of conservation – “Instead of being just a biologist, something for which I was trained, I must also be an educator, diplomat, fundraiser, politician, anthropologist...”",Manvi Sharma [manvi.sharma@ashoka.edu.in];,manvi.sharma@ashoka.edu.in,"We will use the problem of wildlife conservation to understand that values of nature can be multiple and that these values may conflct with each other.

We will examine the historical, social, and political processes that shape societal relations with the natural environment. The course has three overarching goals. First, it will help students gain an in-depth understanding of some of the pressing environmental issues of our times, such as the agrarian crisis, climate change, disaster and vulnerability, waste, the industrial food system, struggles over water, and neoliberalization of nature, among others. Second, drawing on a variety of theoretical frameworks, including Marxist, feminist, and post-structuralist perspectives, the course will expose students to a breadth of approaches to environmental questions.

Environment has become an important area of interactions between society, politics, economy and culture. This foundation course will focus on diverse sets of social, economic and cultural values and political, ideological and religious views expressed through environment. The course will discuss how ecological issues are understood in different political and economic systems, ideologies and institutions. In turn, the political, ideological and social essence of ecological problems is manifested by deeply contrasting visions of what structuring society according to nature might mean. Taking a historical approach, the course will strengthen the interaction of natural and social sciences in understanding contemporary environmental politics.

Some of the most pressing issues of our time arise from our impact on the environment. In this course, we will explore questions such as: What obligations, if any, do we have to future generations, other species, or ecosystems, and why?  What does it mean for something to be natural, and does something’s being natural inherently make it worth preserving?  What are the most pressing environmental issues—what exactly are the main threats associated with climate change, and how should we think about them in relation to other environmental issues such as air and water pollution, biodiversity loss, and deforestation? What does justice look like in a world where development may require environmental destruction—or is this a false dichotomy?  What kinds of actions (if any) are ethically required of us as individuals: should ordinary citizens leave action on environmental issues to the state, billionaires, and/or corporations, or ought we to make drastic changes in our own lifestyles?  How can ordinary citizens determine what to think about complex environmental issues when our information environment is polluted by sophisticated campaigns of misinformation, and can we deal with such problems adequately within a liberal democratic society?",Simon Alexander Burns Brown [simon.brown@ashoka.edu.in];,simon.brown@ashoka.edu.in,"gain an understanding of some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time (including their social and political dimensions) and their policy solutions

Overview
The course aims to introduce students to a complex, interdisciplinary understanding of environmental issues and challenges, going beyond simplistic discourses of crisis. The pedagogic design is built around ten questions, framed in very simple terms but designed to crack open disciplinary silos to build a multivalent understanding of linked socioecological systems. It exposes students to a diversity of environmental issues, challenges, processes, perspectives, and actors. The objective is to enable students to gain a more nuanced and historicized understanding of the politics of environmental policy and practice.
Part I of the course walks students through the history of environment-development linkages, showing how these linkages have changed over time and are connected specifically to global geo-politics of the 20th and 21st centuries. Part II focuses on extant environmental solutions, mainstream as well as radical, again teasing out their ontological and epistemological foundations. The course draws on theoretical insights from political economy, environmental and ecological economics, institutional theory, and cultural and political ecology.  
The course will consist of twelve modules, each covering a week with two lectures of 1.5 hours each. Students will be expected to prepare in advance by reading short pieces and/or watching films. Classroom time will consist of lectures and discussion, with follow-up readings assigned to dig deeper into the ideas thrown up during class.

,FC,FC-0201-1,Principles of Science,"This course concerns the nature of Time and the important role it plays in our lives. It introduces the concept of age and time in the context of Physics and Astronomy- how Time is measured, its connection with Space, and why it moves in one direction, as well as the way Time is perceived in biological systems. Through this course we would be like to bring to the students our current understanding about the scale and age of the Universe, and how this knowledge has evolved; how biological systems including human body maintain temporal patterns; the impact of climate change and ecological damage on biological time and the evolution of survival strategies that require the understanding of past, present and future.
The course will start with a general introduction and historical perspective to the concept of time in our day-to-day life and in physics and in biology. We shall discuss the history of measurement of time and invention of clocks. Without involving much mathematics, the course will help students derive relationship between speed of light and time, space-time continuum, age of the universe, stars, earth etc. We would then follow concept of time in biology in the context of birth-growth-ageing-death. Seasonal variations in morphological and life-history traits as measurement of time, mechanism of timekeeping - biological clocks, circadian rhythms. We will also discuss the evolutionary time and the important concepts pertaining to our understanding of this such as generation time of different living beings. The course ends with discussions on human cognition and the concept of time: conceptual understanding of past, present and future.

To be updated,FC,FC-0201-1,Principles of Science,"Course description:
This course throws a light on the principles of science and central role of chemistry in science. Historically, chemistry has been focusing on the variation of matter, their properties and how these matters can undergo interesting chemical transformations. The intriguing chemical and physical properties of these matters attract the attention of scientific community. Chemistry has been the building block of matters, small to large. Materials at different length scales will be addressed and how different pedagogies can explain matter at varying length scales
Therefore, in this course, we will discuss about principles of science involved in the deeper understanding of matters (from quantum dots to supramolecular arrangements) at different length scales.
Focus will be on concepts and units of lengths, change of paradigm and pedagogy as small molecules become larger molecules, polymers, biomolecules, transition from quantum mechanics to classical mechanics at a pedagogical level. General principles of thermodynamics and kinetics will be highlighted as basic principles of science.
At a chemical length scale, periodic table of elements, their electronic structure and properties, introduction to organic chemistry as a great utility in science from building blocks of life to renewable energy, healthcare, medicines, and materials with value-addition in society will be discussed to understand logic of chemical reactivity.

A formidable combination of astronomical and geological conditions has made it possible for the Earth to harbour life on it. But there are many catastrophic events in the space that may destroy life, even the planet which in the vast cosmic arena appears as a mote of dust suspended in a beam of sunlight and floating in the vast emptiness of space. Search for extra-terrestrial life has taught us an important lesson that our world, mother Earth is an extremely rare place in our galaxy and possibly the only planet that has the required astrophysical and geological conditions for harbouring life. Even if there are other planets similar to the Earth wherein life may exist, the number of such planets in the vast galaxy is extremely small and so we are alone at least within a radius of few hundreds of light years. This course will unfold the fact that our home, the planet Earth is so special yet so vulnerable, so crowded yet so lonely, so common yet so unique, so insignificant yet so great! 
        The following topics will be covered in the whole course: 
(i)    Our address in the Universe, the hierarchy in the structure of the visible Universe – super clusters of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, galaxies, the Milky Way Galaxy, stars: the building blocks of galaxies, The Sun and the Solar System. 
(ii)   Birth of the Sun and its planets including the Earth. A brief history of the solar planets
(iii)  We are made of star dust – the origin of heavy elements including carbon the building block of organic molecules. 
(iv)   Life is a puzzle: Definition of life- its main functions: Metabolism, replication and evolution by natural selection.  Origin of life on the Earth.  
(v)   Evolution of life in a changing Earth – the first, second and the third atmosphere of the Earth, formation of the Oceans, Continents and forest. The ecological system. 
(vi)  The potential threats to the Earth – Astronomical, Geological and Man-made threats. Extinction of life in the past. 
(vii) The natural protection for life – The extremely rare combination of astronomical and geological coincidences that has enabled life on the Earth to survive and evolve.  
(viii)  Are we alone? Search for extra-terrestrial biosignature and techno-signature. 
(ix)    The evolution of the Sun – from a faint young star to a red giant and a changing environment of the Earth – from habitable to uninhabitable planet.

Fcaulty: Prof. Vikram Vyas
The world around us and the universe at large is full of extraordinarily rich events, from lightning in the sky, the motion of planets and the birth of a star. At first glance, there seems to be nothing in common between these myriad phenomena. Yet over centuries, we have discerned patterns and distilled laws of nature. The aim of this course is to appreciate the fundamental principles underlying our understanding of the universe. In doing so, we will learn the conceptual foundations of the laws of nature and see how science is actually practiced and how its principles emerge.
There are no formal prerequisites for this course. We will use mathematics sparingly - some arithmetic and drawing graphs and diagrams.",Vikram Vyas [vikram.vyas@ashoka.edu.in];,vikram.vyas@ashoka.edu.in,"The course is divided into three conceptual parts:

3.1 Motion and Spacetime
We will start our journey with the simple concept of a moving object. We will see that when we try to pin down this concept, we are led to apparent paradoxes which we will resolve using Newton’s ideas. Once we have a feel for what we mean by motion, we will start mapping the universe not just in space but also in time. Our journey will include:
1. Zeno’s paradox and its resolution
2. Charting the heavens with some help from Newton
3. Spacetime from Galileo to Einstein
4. Einstein’s happiest thought
5. Clocks, GPS and black holes

• Tim Maudlin, Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time. Princeton University Press, 2012.
A clear and accessible introduction to the philosophical and conceptual foundations of space and time.
3.2 Quantum Mechanics and Reality
In the second part of the course, we will go through some experiments that will challenge all that we have learned in the first part, and we will be forced to question the  intuitive idea of reality that we hold.
1. Two experiments with one electron
2. One experiment with two electrons
3. Quantum mechanics
4. Einstein’s objection to quantum mechanics: EPR paradox
5. Bell’s theorem and the answer to: Is the Moon There When Nobody Looks?
  Readings

– Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics
– Bertlmann’s Socks and the Nature of Reality
These two essays for laypeople are strongly recommended. Bell was deeply influenced by Einstein’s view of reality and wanted to confirm that the view was correct, but Bell’s own work proved that the universe as we know it, does not follow Einstein’s idea of reality. His essays are poignant and lyrical and are great examples of how  science is practiced by some of the most original thinkers of our time.
  3.3 The Second law of Thermodynamics and The Arrow of Time
There are laws of nature that emerge only when we consider a very large collection of particles. Perhaps the most remarkable of these laws is the second law of thermodynamics, which provides the arrow of time that is missing in the fundamental laws of Newton and Schr ̈odinger, and it may provide the link between spacetime and quantum mechanics—the elusive theory of quantum gravity.

Course title: The origin of life: An interdisciplinary puzzle

Course outline:
This course will attempt to teach principles through a broad exploration of an open question in science: How did life originate? This is a question that has intrigued mankind through the ages. Today it is being investigated at the interface of physics, chemistry, biology and the earth sciences. The course will touch upon some of the established principles and methods of these sciences. It will also exemplify how science explores the unknown – by a combination of hypothesis, experiment, observation and theory. 
‘How did life originate?’ is a question about the sequence of events that culminated in the appearance of the first living systems, and, as such, is a question about history. It shares features with other historical questions such as those about the history of the universe as a whole, history of life on Earth, and the origin of complex human societies. The course will also reflect upon what is common between these historical questions and what is different.
Topics covered will include:
1. Selected topics from the sciences: Time evolution in physics, history of the universe, the prebiotic Earth, atoms and molecules, chemical reactions, catalysis, complexity of the simplest living cells, evolution in biology, a brief history of the biosphere. 
2. Hypotheses for the origin of life, experiments simulating the environment of the primordial Earth, estimate of the (im)probability of life to appear, life beyond Earth. 
The above list is not exhaustive and nor are the topics listed in chronological order of appearance in the course. There will be a back-and-forth between different topics. The course will employ some mathematics which will be taught within the course as needed.","Sanjay Jain [sanjay.jain@ashoka.edu.in] ,Kabeer Kumar [kabeer.kumar_tf@ashoka.edu.in];","sanjay.jain@ashoka.edu.in, kabeer.kumar_tf@ashoka.edu.in","Students will learn some basic facts about systems studied in physics, chemistry, biology and the earth sciences. They will appreciate the complexity of living systems in contrast to the systems traditionally studied in the physical sciences. They will learn why the origin of life is an important scientific puzzle and place it in the perspective of other historical processes. They will also learn the present status of the field and how ideas from different disciplines are relevant to it. They will see an explicit example of how science at its frontiers thrives by the existence of multiple viewpoints.",FC-0801-7,"Pre-requisites: None.

potential to define, destroy, and heal? This course takes texts from across the world and focuses
on this relation between the individual and the family; the joy and burden of kinship; the
networks of relations that bind and set us free. In the process, we also hope to gain an
understanding of literature as an institution, and its role in telling stories that are both real and
imaginary.

Course Philosophy:
A key to a robust and fulfilling class experience is that the instructor and students have a
common understanding on what the course is about, i.e., not only what it will do, but also what it
will not include or focus upon. The instructor will make sure that this understanding of the
course, as a whole and in parts, is communicated. However, feel free to approach us in case of
any questions and discussions that may arise in your mind. Do note that the course will proceed
sequentially so that you have time to read all the texts; however, the duration spent on each text
may sometimes vary depending upon the nature of interest and involvement we feel.
Students are expected to procure and read all the primary texts. Secondary text excerpts and
articles will be made available to the class. They will inform our reading of the primary texts, but
we may not have the time to discuss each and every piece in class.
The instructor likes to be interrupted; so please do not wait for cues to participate in
class—instead, view the classroom experience as an adda (without food, of course!). Allow room
for both focused and meaningful digressions.",Rita Kothari [rita.kothari@ashoka.edu.in];,rita.kothari@ashoka.edu.in,,FC-0701-2,"Class Etiquette:
Students may bring hot or cold beverages to class, but no food will be allowed into class. Only
documents used for class discussion may be opened during class.",

This course will offer an introduction to liberal arts education as it might be practiced in a literature classroom for non-specialists, including students who may major in any subject at Ashoka – a be it literature, economics, or biology. Our focus will be on English as a world language, and particularly one of global literature. How did the British Empire shape a global terrain of colonial modernity? How did that modernity merge with Anglo-American globalization of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries? How did this create the English-speaking and English-reading worlds, and how did it turn English into a
language of world literature? We will examine the transnational trajectory of this diverse and diffuse body of writing, including work from spaces with vastly different histories – the colonies in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia, and the hard-to-classify context of South Africa.

,FC,FC-0201-1,Literature and the World,"Literature lives in a strange place where the word meets the world: here, the fantastical can seem familiar and the mundane may seem bizarre. The act of reading allows us to imagine the strange worlds of others as if we lived in them, and, equally, to reimagine our everyday worlds as if we viewed them through unfamiliar eyes. This imaginative encounter with otherness—other people, other perspectives, other places, and other worlds—lies at the heart of the literary experience. 
In South Asia, the literary encounter with otherness is inextricable from the worldly encounters of caste. The aesthetics of caste inform our literary sensibilities, the social experiences of caste frame the world we inhabit, and the everyday performances of caste shape our bodies. In short, the encounters that create our aesthetic, social, and embodied experiences—between the word and the world, between the self and the other, and between the real and the imagined—are all entangled with caste.   
This course will examine the relationship between literature and the world by focussing on the aesthetic, social, and embodied experiences of caste. We will ask: What can caste and literature tell us about each other? What do the intersections of caste and literature tell us about the world? How does our experience of the world inform and inflect our responses to literary representations of caste? And, perhaps most important, how will this kind of literary experience help us inhabit the world?

We will read select books (and extracts) from a wide range of themes and ask ourselves what makes them great.

Over the first eight/ nine weeks, we will closely read a wide range of texts, both fiction and non-fiction, in and out of class.

,FC,FC-0201-1,Great Books,"This course seeks to reflect on care and love both conceptually and experientially. What does it mean to love and care for oneself and for others? What allows us to love and care? What prevents us from caring and loving ourselves and others? What forces—personal, interpersonal, or collective and communal—regulate, prescribe and even prohibit experiences and expressions of love.
Our primary goal in the course is to work towards developing a critical and comprehensive language around understanding care and love as the basis for any and all configurations of relationalities that both make and unmake our senses of being in the world. Beginning our journey with selections from The Symposium by Plato, verses from the Gatha Sattasai, and poetry from the Akam repertoire of Sangam literature, we will make our way through more contemporary iterations and meditations on caring and loving such as, Roland Barthes’ A Lover’s Discourse and Ocean Vuong’s On Earth We Are Briefly Gorgeous. All along the way we will be reflecting on and attempting to problematize “traditional” and “normative” structures within which care and love are usually understood and experienced.",S Satish Kumar [s.kumar@ashoka.edu.in];,s.kumar@ashoka.edu.in,"To understand representations of caring and loving in literature and culture.

,FC,FC-0201-1,Great Books,"In this course we will critique the notion of ""greatness"" as such relative to what it suggests both about The Human and about processes of canon formation, i.e. what makes a ""Great Book."" We will do so by looking at the figure of Prometheus. In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans, for which he was tied to a mountain while an eagle ate at his liver. As an adjective, ""Promethean"" connotes forward-thinking, activeness, striving, defiance of whatever inexorable forces lie beyond our control, and domination. Prometheus is thus an archetype who appears again and again in literary history. But in this class we will also read texts that think about the non- or un-Promethean, texts that are decidedly not ""great"" insofar as they thematize the small or present us with characters who relate to the world in ways very different from all we associate with Prometheus.","Alexander Robert Phillips [alexander.phillips@ashoka.edu.in] ,Aditya Singh Chauhan [aditya.chauhan_tf@ashoka.edu.in] ,Shruti Sarkar [shruti.sarkar_tf@ashoka.edu.in];","alexander.phillips@ashoka.edu.in, shruti.sarkar_tf@ashoka.edu.in, aditya.chauhan_tf@ashoka.edu.in",,FC-0601-6,"A course reader will be prepared.

,FC,FC-0201-1,"Economy, Politics and Society","Is there a straightforward relationship between proliferation of media and democracy? Does freedom for media necessarily mean democratic freedom? What if free media translates into corporatized control over media platforms, algorithms, content- eventually over publics themselves? How do we reconcile the rise of digital technologies that evoke narratives of emancipation, autonomy, and freedom with the simultaneous rise of online troll cultures, virulent racism, sexism, xenophobia, and exclusionary political ideologies around the globe? Answers to questions such as these depend, to begin with, on how we approach understandings of media, democracy, or freedom. 
We will think about mediation as social process that extends beyond ‘the media’- not as power emanating from specific objects, technologies, or institutional practices, but as the ideological foundation of social life. We explore the relationships of media with electoral democracy and its political institutions, but also what they mean for ordinary people outside of its formal and elite institutions- their local meanings and practices, contestations and shifting forms of power, and the multiplicity of desires they both produce and represent. Towards these objectives, we examine the actions of governments that relate to repression of media and democratic freedoms- and the struggles to liberate them; but also, how morally loaded concepts such as `freedom’ are given particular meanings in their discourses and social practices. 
The challenge in this course will be to apprehend the dominant configurations of `media’ and `democracy’ in present times as well as anticipate imaginations of their possible forms and praxis that might provide for a more diverse and equal world.","Chitralekha Dhamija [chitralekha@ashoka.edu.in] ,Meher Kaur [meher.kaur_tf@ashoka.edu.in] ,Aadya Jha [aadya.jha_ug2023@ashoka.edu.in] ,Madiha Tariq [madiha.tariq_ug2023@ashoka.edu.in];","chitralekha@ashoka.edu.in, meher.kaur_tf@ashoka.edu.in, aadya.jha_ug2023@ashoka.edu.in, madiha.tariq_ug2023@ashoka.edu.in","Students will acquire a conceptual and empirical acquaintance with:

We begin by investigating the relationship between the Economy and Society with theoretical frameworks and moving toward real-world observations, to understand how the structure and logic of capitalism have evolved over time.Themes such as consumerism, technological progress, surplus accumulation, among others are explored both as features of capitalism and for their impact on business, labour processes, and society at large. Engaging with both classical and contemporary thinkers, the course helps students uncover the economic value chain, question dominant narratives, and connect abstract economic ideas to everyday realities.

It traces the evolution of modern South Asia from 1818 to 1947, examining key social, political, and economic transformations under colonial rule.
We will explore major figures who engaged with — and shaped — the political and social struggles of the period, alongside critical debates on religious reform, women’s roles, caste hierarchies, communalism, and nation formation. Special attention will be given to the complexity of colonial governance, economic change, and social contestations.
Students will engage with a range of primary texts — including autobiographies, speeches, political treatises, ethnographies, and literary fiction — to analyze how ideas of economy, politics, and society were debated and reimagined in colonial South Asia.
Course Goals:
Read, think, and evaluate critically about modern South Asian economy, politics, and society
Acquire foundational knowledge of major historical and political developments in modern South Asia
Understand key figures, movements, and debates that shaped South Asian society and politics under colonialism
Examine the economic underpinnings of colonial rule and their impact on society and politics
Understand the emergence and construction of communalism in the region
Develop skills to critically analyze primary sources and debates",Ravindran S [ravindran.sriramachandran@ashoka.edu.in];,ravindran.sriramachandran@ashoka.edu.in,"By the end of the course, students will be able to:

This course addresses a diverse range of issues in economics and public policy in a non-technical way. It emphasizes the intuition behind complex economic ideas and also explores the connections of economics with other disciplines – psychology, philosophy, finance, sociology and political science—for example. Finally, it  explores India specific problems such as premature such as the risk of a middle-income trap. The aim is to blend an understanding of current issues with the history of ideas to leave students with a quick but comprehensive idea of the science and art of economics.
